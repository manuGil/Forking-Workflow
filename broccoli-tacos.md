1. Place a griddle pan over a high heat, scatter in 50g of pumpkin seeds and toast for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to a bowl.
2. Cut 1 head of broccoli into 1cm slices, then toss in a little olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Lay them on the hot griddle and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until charred and just cooked through â€“ you want them to retain a bit of bite.
3. Peel, destone and slice 3 ripe avocados into wedges.
4. Remove the broccoli from the griddle and add the avocado wedges, griddling until lightly charred on both sides.
5. For the dressing, put 45g of fresh coriander (stalks and all) into a blender with 250g of ricotta and 1 splash of milk. Squeeze in the juice from 2 limes and peel and finely grate in 1 clove of garlic.
6. Season with salt and pepper, blitz until combined, then spoon onto a platter.
7. Top the dressing with the griddled veg and a drizzle of olive oil. Pick over the remaining 15g of coriander leaves and sprinkle with the toasted pumpkin seeds.
8. Finish with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. Serve with a pile of tacos and let everyone help themselves.
